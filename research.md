Since 2016 I have worked with colleagues from Cognitive Science, Computer
Science, and the School of Education on a project studying [spatial cognition
and block building][blocks-site]. Before this I worked in several areas of
applied machine learning, including surgical action recognition, medical NLP,
and speech recognition.
