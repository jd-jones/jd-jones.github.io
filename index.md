I'm a graduate student (since 2014) in the [ECE department][ece-page] at Johns
Hopkins, where I'm advised by [Sanjeev Khudanpur][sanjeev-page] and
[Greg Hager][greg-page]. I am affiliated with the Center for Language and
Speech Processing ([CLSP][clsp]) and the the Computational Interaction and Robotics Lab
([CIRL][cirl]).

My research interests include statistical signal processing,
computer vision, graphical models, and information theory.

# News
**Nov 5, 2018:** Our paper, *Toward computer vision systems that understand
real-world assembly processes*, has been accepted at WACV 2019.
