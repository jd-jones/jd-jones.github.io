I'm a graduate student in the [ECE department][ece-page] at Johns
Hopkins, where I'm advised by [Sanjeev Khudanpur][sanjeev-page] and
[Greg Hager][greg-page]. I am affiliated with the [Center for Language and
Speech Processing][clsp] and the the [Computational Interaction and Robotics Lab][cirl].

My work uses structured prediction and machine learning to enable perception in complex, real-world scenarios.
I specialize in timeseries and multi-modal signal processing, and have prior experience in fine-grained activity recognition, automatic speech recognition, and medical applications of AI.
